| Operation | Description | HTTP request example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::Filtering``` | Sets JSON API filtering with ```all_filters``` as default matcher | ```GET /users?filter[email-eq]=user@email.com&filter[name-cont]=son&match=any_filters``` |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::PerformFiltering``` | Provides JSON API filtering with ```ctx[:filter_options]``` options | ```GET /users?filter[email-eq]=user@email.com&filter[name-cont]=son&match=any_filters``` |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::Sorting``` | Sets JSON API sorting | ```GET /users?sort=name,-age``` |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::PerformOrdering``` | Provides JSON API sorting | ```GET /users?sort=name,-age``` |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::Inclusion``` | Provides JSON API inclusion of related resources. Dot-separated relationship path supporting not implemented at this time | ```GET /users?include=team,organization``` |
| ```Api::V1::Lib::Operation::Pagination``` | Provides JSON API pagination with offset strategy. Accepts ```AciveRelation``` or ```Array``` as collection. By default returns 25 items per page | ```GET /users?page[number]=1&page[size]=1``` |

| ```ApplicationOperation``` | Base application operation class |
| ```ApplicationContract``` | Base application contract class. Use it for build/update entity. Otherwise use ```Dry::Validation.Schema``` |
| ```ApplicationDecorator``` | Base application decorator class |
| ```ApplicationSerializer``` | Base application serializer class |
| ```ApplicationWorker``` | Base application worker class |

### Upload files

Boilerplate used `Shrine` for upload files local and to S3.
Create you own uploader and inherit it from `ApplicationUploader`.
For more [info](https://shrinerb.com/docs/getting-started)

## Docker

Install [docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
```
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
```

### Run the project

```
docker-compose up
```

### Running the tests

```
bin/docker rspec
```

### Building API documentation

Building api documentation is pretty easy, just run:

```
bin/docker rails api:doc:v1
```

and find it into:

```
./public/api/docs/v1/index.html
```

### Running Rails console

```
bin/docker rails c
```

### Running linters

```
lefthook run all
```

### Using DIP

You can develop you application with `DIP`([more info](https://github.com/bibendi/dip))

For running services with docker.

```
dip run `the name of service`
```

Launch application with all services.
```
dip provision
```

List all available run commands.
```
dip ls
```
### Sentry Notifire

To start work with sentry you should add dsn key to credentials under `sentry_dsn` name.

To get first error with `Sentry` raise `Raven.capture_exception` with exception as an argument.
